## Introduction

Welcome to my C Programming Problem Solving Repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various problems implemented using the C programming language.

As an enthusiast of high-level programming and computer science, I've been honing my skills in C programming. This repository serves as a showcase of my problem-solving abilities and understanding of C language concepts.

## About C Programming Language

C is a powerful high-level programming language known for its efficiency, portability, and versatility. It provides low-level access to system resources, making it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem solution is organized into its own directory within the repository.
- Each directory contains the C source code file `.c` along with any necessary documentation.
- Problem statements or descriptions are provided within the README.md files of each directory for better understanding.

## Problems Solved

The entire repository has been divided into two sections:
<br>`Practice Problems`<br>
`Project Works`<br>

Here's a sneak peek at some of the problems I've solved using C programming:

1. Hello World Program
2. Arithmetic Operators in C
3. Find the factorial of a number
4. Check if a number is prime
5. Calculate the Fibonacci series
6. Reverse a string
7. Find the largest element in an array
8. Sort an array in ascending order
9. Implement linear search in an array
10. Implement binary search in a sorted array

... (list continues up to 100)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the directory of the problem you're interested in.
3. Open the C source code file (*.c) using any text editor or a C compiler.
4. Read the problem statement provided in the README.md file.
5. Compile and run the C code using a C compiler to see the solution in action!
